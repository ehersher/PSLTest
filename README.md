# PSLTest

1. Download and install Java SE 13 here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk13-archive-downloads.html.

2. Download IntelliJ Ultimate IDE here https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows. There is a free 30 day trial

3. For this particular repository, I find it easiest to clone through the Intellij welcome page although traditional command-line should work as well.

4. Click on "Get from Version Control"

5. In the URL field, enter the link to the repository: https://github.com/ehersher/PSLTest. Then click "clone"

6. With Intellij open, click 'File', then 'Project Structure' then click on 'add dependency' as shown in this screenshot https://imgur.com/a/XObDK0V
